This example shows how to mock a final class (singleton class particularly).
In this example I have used PowerMock, which supports final class to be mocked and also supports testing static method.

Useful point:
1. @RunWith(PowerMockRunner.class)
2. PowerMockito.mockStatic(Afinal.class)


Please refer to Application.java file an actual java class in which there is dependency of a singleton class, which will be mocked in test class (ApplicationTest.java)
